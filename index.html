        <p>
          Our users are having trouble keeping track of everything they have going on in their lives; from classes, to work, to personal obligations. Physical planners take up space and can be easily forgotten, and many digital alternatives donâ€™t have everything our users need. Our solution should be to develop an all-in-one solution that will notify students of tasks and allow students to modify it to their needs.
